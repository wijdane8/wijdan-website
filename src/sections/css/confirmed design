Typography:

Primary Headline Font: 'Cairo', sans-serif (Used for headings, buttons, social links - modern and bold)
Paragraph Font: 'Tajawal', sans-serif (Used for body text, taglines - clean and readable)
Font Weights: Headings and buttons use heavier font weights (700 or 800) for emphasis, while body text uses normal weight (400).
Styling and UI/UX:

Neumorphism: Employed extensively using box-shadow to create soft, extruded or inset effects for sections and buttons, giving a modern, digital feel. Shadows are stronger on hover and active states.
Rounded Corners: border-radius is used throughout (20px for sections, 16px for buttons) for a softer, less harsh UI.
Shimmer Animation: A subtle radial gradient shimmer effect is added to the Hero section for visual interest.
Hover Effects: Elements like Hero sections and buttons have subtle hover effects with background color changes, stronger shadows, and slight translateY movements to provide user feedback.
RTL (Right-to-Left) Support: The design is explicitly set up for Right-to-Left text direction (direction: rtl; and text-align: right; in body), suitable for Arabic and other RTL languages. Animations like slideInRTL are also adapted for RTL.
Responsive Design: Media queries are included to adjust layout and font sizes for smaller screens (max-width: 768px), ensuring good display on different devices.
Button Text Transform: Buttons use text-transform: uppercase; for a consistent, modern button style.
Overall Impression:

The confirmed design is clean, modern, and feminine, using a soft color palette and neumorphic styling to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, with specific attention to Right-to-Left language support.
